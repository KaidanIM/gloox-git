BOSH Todo
--------------

Multiple connections, working on, untested

Better handling for inactivity, will likely be implemented as I work on multiple connections
XEP-0206 stream restart for SASL, implemented (as per XEP), untested
Polling, implemented, buggy and needs more testing (after multiple connections)

Acks, unimplemented, untested (no idea which servers support this yet)
Session pausing, unimplemented, untested (also needs researching wrt. server support)
HTTPS, needs research, unimplemented, untested

Quick changes:
Improve generation of first rid (I'm not sure, but I think it is not random enough... likely need larger possible range)
Implement total sent/received in getStatistics()
