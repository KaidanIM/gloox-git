 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The design of gloox follows the so-called observer pattern, which basically means that everything is
 * event-driven. There are two ways you can connect to the Jabber/XMPP network using gloox, either as
 * client or as component. A third way, as server, is not supported by gloox, even though it might be
 * possible to get something going.
 *
 * @note Section 11.5 of the XMPP specification (RFC 3290) requires that only UTF-8 is used as encoding
 * for any traffic sent over the wire. Since gloox cannot know which encoding is used in any given input,
 * it is a requirement that any input to gloox is valid UTF-8.
 *
 * @section handlers_sec Event Handlers
 *
 * The most important tools of gloox are the event handlers. Currently, there exist 4 handlers for
 * the basic protocol as defined in the RFCs, as well as 8 handlers for events generated by the included
 * JEP-implementations. Additionally, a log handler, a generic tag handler and a handler for connection
 * events are available.
 *
 * Basically these handlers are virtual interfaces from which you derive a class and implement a few
 * virtual functions. Then you register such an object with the respective protocol implementation. A
 * short example:
 * @code
 * class MyClass : public PresenceHandler
 * {
 *   public:
 *     // reimplemented from PresenceHandler
 *     virtual void handlePresence( Stanza *stanza );
 *
 *   [...]
 * };
 *
 * void MyClass::handlePresence( Stanza *stanza )
 * {
 *   // extract further information from the stanza
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Somewhere else you do something like this:
 * @code
 * OtherClass::doSomething()
 * {
 *   Client *client = new Client( ... );
 *   [...]
 *   MyClass *handler = new MyClass( ... );
 *   client->registerPresenceHandler( handler );
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, everytime a presence stanza (not subscription stanza) is received, handlePresence() is called
 * with the current stanza as argument. You can then use the extensive getters of the Stanza class to
 * extract stanza data.
 *
 * This works similar for all the other event handlers.
 * Another example, this time using the connection event handler (class @link gloox::ConnectionListener
 * ConnectionListener @endlink):
 * @code
 * class MyClass : public ConnectionListener
 * {
 *   public:
 *     virtual void onConnect();
 *
 *     virtual bool onTLSConnect( ... );
 * };
 *
 * void MyClass::onConnect()
 * {
 *   // do something when the connection is established
 * }
 *
 * bool MyClass::onTLSConnect( const CertInfo& info )
 * {
 *   // decide whether you trust the certificate, examine the CertInfo structure
 *   return true; // if you trust it, otherwise return false
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The ConnectionListener interface is a peculiarity. You MUST re-implement
 * @link gloox::ConnectionListener::onTLSConnect() ConnectionListener::onTLSConnect() @endlink if
 * you want to be able to connect successfully to TLS/SSL enabled servers. Even though gloox tries
 * to verify the server's certificate it does not automatically trust a server. The client programmer
 * and/or user have to decide whether to trust a server or not. This trust is expressed by the return
 * value of onTLSConnect(). @b False means you don't trust the server/certificate and as a consequence
 * the connection is dropped immediately.
 *
 * @section comp_sec Components
 *
 * A component in the Jabber/XMPP network is an add-on to a server which runs externally
 * to the actual server software, but can have similar privileges. Components use a protocol described in
 * JEP-0114 to connect and authenticate to a server.
 *
 * The @link gloox::Component Component @endlink class supports this protocol and can be used to create
 * a new Jabber component. It's as simple as:
 * @code
 * Component *comp = new Component( ... );
 * comp->connect();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section client_sec Clients
 *
 * A client can be an end-user's chat client, a bot, or a similar entity not tied to a particular
 * server. The @link gloox::Client Client @endlink class implements the necessary functionality to
 * connect to an XMPP server. Usage is, again, pretty simple:
 * @code
 * class MyClass : public ConnectionListener, PresenceHandler
 * {
 *   public:
 *     void doSomething();
 *
 *     virtual void handlePresence( ... );
 *
 *     virtual void onConnect();
 *
 *     virtual bool onTLSConnect( const CertInfo& info );
 * };
 *
 * void MyClass::doSomething()
 * {
 *   JID jid( "jid@server/resource" );
 *   Client *client = new Client( jid, "password" );
 *   client->registerConnectionListener( this );
 *   client->registerPresenceHandler( this );
 *   client->connect();
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::onConnect()
 * {
 *   // connection established, auth done (see API docs for exceptions)
 * }
 *
 * bool MyClass::onTLSConnect( const CertInfo& info )
 * {
 *   // examine certificate info
 * }
 *
 * void MyClass::handlePresence( Stanza *stanza )
 * {
 *   // presence info
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note gloox does not (and will not) support the style of connection which is usually used on port
 * 5223, i.e. SSL encryption before any XML is sent, because it's a legacy method and not standard XMPP.
 *
 * @note @link gloox::Client::connect() Client::connect() @endlink by default blocks until the
 * connection ends (either @link gloox::Client::disconnect() Client::disconnect() @endlink is called
 * or the server closes the connection).
 *
 * @section block_conn_sec Blocking vs. Non-blocking Connections
 *
 * For some kind of bots a blocking connection (the default behaviour) is ideal. All the bot does is
 * react to events coming from the server. However, for end user clients or anything with a GUI this
 * is far from perfect.
 *
 * In these cases non-blocking connections can be used. If
 * @link gloox::ClientBase::connect() ClientBase::connect( false ) @endlink is
 * called, the function returnes immediately after the connection has been established. It is then
 * the resposibility of the programmer to initiate receiving of data from the socket.
 *
 * The easiest way is to call @link gloox::ClientBase::recv() ClientBase::recv() @endlink
 * periodically with the desired timeout (in seconds) as parameter. The default value of -1
 * means the call blocks until any data was received, which is then parsed automatically.
 *
 * As an alternative to periodic polling you can use
 * @link gloox::ClientBase::fileDescriptor() ClientBase::fileDescriptor() @endlink to get a hold
 * of the raw file descriptor used for the connection. You can then use select() on it and use
 * @link gloox::ClientBase::recv() ClientBase::recv() @endlink when select indicates that data is
 * available. You should @b not recv() any data from the file descriptor directly as there is no
 * way to feed that back into the parser.
 *
 * @section roster_sec Roster Management
 *
 * Among others, RFC 3921 defines the protocol to manage one's contact list (roster). In gloox, the
 * @link gloox::RosterManager RosterManager @endlink class implements this functionality. A few
 * easy-to-use functions are available to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the presence of remote
 * entities. It is also possible to add a contact to a roster without actually subscribing to the
 * contacts presence. Additionally, the interface @link gloox::RosterListener RosterListener @endlink
 * offers many callbacks for various roster-related events.
 *
 * If you create a Client object as shown above, you also get a RosterManager for free.
 * @link gloox::Client::rosterManager() Client::rosterManager() @endlink returns a pointer to the
 * object.
 *
 * @section privacy_sec Privacy Lists
 *
 * Also defined in RFC 3921: Privacy Lists. A Privacy List can be used to explicitely block or allow
 * sending of stanzas from and to contacts, respectively. You can define rules based on JID, stanza type,
 * etc. Needless to say that gloox implements Privacy Lists as well. ;) The
 * @link gloox::PrivacyManager PrivacyManager @endlink class and the
 * @link gloox::PrivacyListHandler PrivacyListHandler @endlink virtual interface allow for full
 * flexibility in Privacy List handling.
 *
 * @code
 * PrivacyManager *p = new PrivacyManager( ... );
 * [...]
 * PrivacyListHandler::PrivacyList list;
 * PrivacyItem item( PrivacyItem::TYPE_JID, PrivacyItem::ACTION_DENY,
 *                   PrivacyItem::PACKET_MESSAGE, "me@there.com" );
 * list.push_back( item );
 *
 * PrivacyItem item2( PrivacyItem::TYPE_JID, PrivacyItem::ACTION_ALLOW,
 *                    PrivacyItem::PACKET_IQ, "me@example.org" );
 * list.push_back( item2 );
 *
 * p->store( "myList", list );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section auth_sec Authentication
 *
 * gloox supports old-style IQ-based authentication defined in JEP-0078 as well as several SASL mechanisms.
 * See the documentation of the @link gloox::Client Client @endlink class for more information.
 *
 * @section msg_sec Sending and Receiving of Chat Messages
 *
 * For Messaging it is recommended to use the MessageSession interface. It handles sending and receiving
 * of messages as well as message events and chat states (such as typing notification, etc.). See
 * @link gloox::MessageSession MessageSession @endlink for more details.
 *
 * @section jeps_sec Protocol Enhancements
 *
 * The Jabber Software Foundation has published a number of extensions to the core protocols, called
 * Jabber Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). A couple of these JEPs are implemented in gloox.
