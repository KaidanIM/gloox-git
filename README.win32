Building on Win32 is experimental and correct functionality is untested.

You need:
- MinGW (http://mingw.org)

Optional:
- Bloodshed Dev-C++ (http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html)

A project file for Bloodshed Dev-C++ is included (gloox.dev)

- Edit config.h.win to suit your needs.
- Add additional libs you have available to the project.
- build
