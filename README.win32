Building on Win32
-----------------

gloox compiles (at least) on
- MinGW (http://mingw.org)
- MSVC 6
No other compilers have been tested.
However, successful compilation has been reported for VS2003, VS2005, and VS2005 .NET Express.

See README.wince for info on building gloox for Win CE/Mobile

Project files for Code::Blocks (gloox.cbp) and MSVC 6 (gloox.dsp) are included.

- Edit config.h.win to suit your needs.
- Add additional libs you have available to the project.
- If you have an old Platform SDK (e.g. the one shipped with stock MSVC6, which lacks windns.h),
  undefine HAVE_WINDNS_H in config.h.win. SRV resolving is disabled in this case.
- You will also need a newer Platform SDK if you wanted to use winapi's TLS implementation (SChannel).
  Undefine HAVE_WINTLS in config.h.win if you don't have schannel.h.


Building gloox in MinGW and Code::Blocks
----------------------------------------

gloox should build out of the box on MinGW.


Building gloox on MSVC
----------------------

- use the included project file or create your own
- adjust include + library paths if necessary
- to receive any debug output you should use the LogSink facilities (this is not win32-specific)
- build


Building libidn in Win32
------------------------

- install mingw + msys from http://www.mingw.org, including mingw-utils
- build libidn 1.1 or above in msys/mingw

if you want to use libidn in MSVC:
- create msvc import libs:
  pexports libidn-11.dll > libidn-11.def
  lib /def:libidn-11.def


Linking your application against gloox
--------------------------------------

- When building a program that links against gloox, make sure you have GLOOX_IMPORTS defined.
- Make sure you use the same runtime library for both gloox and your app.
