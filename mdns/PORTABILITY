Known Portability Issues
------------------------

- avoid use of streams as far as possible for now
  problematic (non-existent) on (old) WinCE

- don't rely on list/map::erase returning the next iterator

- define a template based on a template from an argument (old MSVC++ ?)
  eg
    template < typename T >
    void func( const std::list< T* >& l );

- avoid std::string::clear(), it's not portable

- when commenting out function arguments, avoid Foo */*bar*/
  MSVC doesn't like that
