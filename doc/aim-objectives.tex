\section{Aim and Objectives}

\subsection{Aim}
\paragraph{}
The aim of this project is to design and implement a problem-independent software framework that helps setting up a dynamic cluster, supporting an arbitrary number of machines. Computationally expensive tasks can then be distributed to the nodes of this cluster.
\paragraph{}
Communication of these nodes with the coordinating master will happen by means of the Extensible Message and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

\subsection{Objectives}
\paragraph{}
The project is split into several sub-tasks which mostly depend on one another. The particular dependencies, as fixed for the final schedule, are listed in Figure \ref{tab:fin_actionplan} on page \pageref{tab:fin_actionplan}.

\paragraph{}
The following subsidiary objectives are considered part of the project aim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Requirements Specification for the project as a whole
\item Design of the individual parts of the project (Worker, Feeder, sample implementations, Statistics Viewer, Feeder Frontend)
\item Defining the database structure
\item Writing the XMPP Client Library
\item Writing the Worker Library
\item Writing the Feeder Library
\item Writing a Sample Worker implementation
\item Writing a Sample Feeder implementation
\item Writing the Feeder Frontend
\item Writing the Statistics Viewer
\item Writing User Manuals and generating API documentation
\end{enumerate}
Items 1 through 6 are considered core parts of the project. Therefore, most attention will be paid to these tasks.
