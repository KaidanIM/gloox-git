\section{Contents of the CD}
\paragraph{}
The enclosed CD contains a complete copy of the Subversion repository as of April 26 2005 in the \texttt{/fyp-lsbu} subdirectory. This includes the source code of all the software written during the project (in \texttt{/fyp-lsbu/src}) as well as the documentation in \LaTeX{} format (in \texttt{/fyp-lsbu/src}). Additionally, it contains the generated API documentation in the \texttt{/api} subdirectory and a copy of this report in PDF format in the root directory.

\section{Installation Instructions}
\paragraph{}
If all the dependencies listed in Section \ref{sec:depend} are fulfilled, compilation and installation are straight-forward. The following commands will build and install the software:
\\ \texttt{./autogen.sh}
\\ \texttt{./configure}
\\ \texttt{cd src}
\\ \texttt{make} \\

and finally as superuser:
\\ \texttt{make install} \\

\section{Usage Instructions}
\paragraph{}
After the installation, two programs are installed, called \texttt{feedertest} and \texttt{workertest}. These are the sample implementations discussed in Section \ref{sec:samples}. They accept the command line parameters listed in Table \ref{tab:cmdlineworker} and \ref{tab:cmdlinefeeder}, respectively.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Switch} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
\endhead
-d & enable excessive debug output \\
-j & specify the full JID to use to connect \\
-p & the password to authenticate with \\
-f & the full JID of the Feeder \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Command Line Parameters of WorkerTest}
\label{tab:cmdlineworker}
\end{table}

\caption{Command Line Parameters of FeederTest}
\label{tab:cmdlinefeeder}
\end{table}

\paragraph{}
For both, paramaters \texttt{-j} and \texttt{-p} are mandatory. The \texttt{workertest} program additionally needs to know the JID of the Feeder, which is passed using the \texttt{-f} switch.
